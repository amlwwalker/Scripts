WIFI Readme:


Use Wifi honey like so:

sudo ./wifi_honey.sh <ESSID> <CHANNEL> <interface>

to impersonate a wifi network.

wifi honey will create 4 hotspots and open airodump-ng to discover which type of encryption the network is using by watching people connect to it.
Once discovered, if connection is successful the password can be cracked.
As there is only one wlan being used. Once the type of encryption is discovered the best thing to do is to close wifi-honey and run the script
startAccessPoin.sh remembering to change the ESSID in the script to the one you are trying to impersonate.
When setting up the access point, remember that it is outputting the handshake so using aircrack-ng and a wordlist:

aircrack-ng -w ../word_lists/rockyou.txt cap-01.cap

the handshake file can be used to crack the password.

So you have two options.

First, get the user to connect through you if you can. That is what startAccessPoint.sh will try to do. If this works you will get the handshake.

Deauthing:
You will need to deauth to either watch for a new handshake to steal the password or to get them to connect to your access point....
To do so, using airdump-ng look for the channel that the access point you are going to deauth from is on
then run
sudo airmon-ng start wlan1 <channel>

Then to deauth run:
sudo aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <access point mac address -c <victim mac address> mon0

Test Access Point:
