Wifi Honey

The idea for this script came while watching episode 26 of the Wifi Security
Mega Primer from Security Tube ( http://www.securitytube.net/video/1921 ). If
you have not watched it I highly recommend the series, it a great set of videos.

In the video Vivek explains how to work out what encryption a client is looking
for in a given network by setting up four fake access points, each with a
different type of encryption, None, WEP, WPA and WPA2 and the seeing which of
the four the client connects to.

I've had mixed results with this, especially differentiating between WPA and
WPA2 but as an idea it is sound and it does work some of the time so is
certainly worth trying.

In the case of WPA/WPA2, by running airodump-ng along side this you also end up
capturing the first two packets of the four way handshake and so can attempt to
crack the key with either aircrack-ng or coWPAtty.

What this script does is to automate the setup process, it creates five monitor
mode interfaces, four are used as APs and the fifth is used for airodump-ng. To
make things easier, rather than having five windows all this is done in a screen
session which allows you to switch between screens to see what is going on. All
sessions are labelled so you know which is which.

Installation
============
The script requires screen and the aircrack-ng suite, make sure they are both
installed and in the path.

You then need to make the wifi_honey.sh script executable and off you go.

chmod a+x wifi_honey.sh

Usage
=====
Usage is simple, start the script with the ESSID of the network you want to
impersonate.

./wifi_honey.sh fake_wpa_net

You can also specify the channel to use and the interface you want to base the
whole lot on:

./wifi_honey.sh fake_wpa_net 1 wlan1

The only other thing I can think of is that you should be in the directory with
the wifi_honey_template.rc file in it otherwise it will fail when trying to
create the screen resource file.

If you want to make any changes to the screen resource file, such as changing
the key to change tabs then make these in the wifi_honey_template.rc file, this
is why I kept it as a separate file rather than generating a new one each time.

Sets up:

mon1: no encryption (aa:aa:aa:aa:aa:aa)
mon2: WEP encryption (bb:bb:bb:bb:bb:bb)
mon3: WPA encryption (cc:cc:cc:cc:cc:cc)
mon4: WPA2 encryption (dd:dd:dd:dd:dd:dd)
mon0: airodump for monitoring devices
