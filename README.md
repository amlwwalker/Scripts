Scripts
=======

Scripts that are proving very useful....

Not all these scripts were written by me, however after losing my OS a couple of times I wanted a backup. 
There are many in here, often malicious. I am not responsible for what people do with them. Please just credit me with the ones that are.

I am a pentester and some of these scripts have been extremely useful. I update them as and when I need them. 
They may not be self explanatory - the reason for this is I don't want stupid kids coming along and just using them.
If you can read them, you can use them.
