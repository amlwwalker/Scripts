WIFI Readme:


Use Wifi honey like so:

sudo ./wifi_honey.sh <ESSID> <CHANNEL> <interface>

to impersonate a wifi network.

wifi honey will create 4 hotspots and open airodump-ng to discover which type of encryption the network is using by watching people connect to it.
Once discovered, if connection is successful the password can be cracked.
As there is only one wlan being used. Once the type of encryption is discovered the best thing to do is to close wifi-honey and run the script
startAccessPoin.sh remembering to change the ESSID in the script to the one you are trying to impersonate.
When setting up the access point, remember that it is outputting the handshake so using aircrack-ng and a wordlist:

aircrack-ng -w ../word_lists/rockyou.txt cap-01.cap

the handshake file can be used to crack the password.

So you have two options.

First, get the user to connect through you if you can. That is what startAccessPoint.sh will try to do. If this works you will get the handshake.
You will need to figure out deauthing the clients if no one is already disconnected and trying to connect.

Test Access Point:
